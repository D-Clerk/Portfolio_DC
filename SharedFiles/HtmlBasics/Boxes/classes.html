<h1 class="center"> Here is a Centered Title </h1>
<p class="center emphasized"> "Here is some emphasized and centered content."</p>
<p> Normal content: The old man shook his head. "They get thicker every day," he complained in a thin, undependable  falsetto. "Who'd have thought I'd live to see the time when a man would  be afraid of his life on the way to the Cliff House. When I was a boy,  Edwin, men and women and little babies used to come out here from San  Francisco by tens of thousands on a nice day. And there weren't any  bears then. No, sir. They used to pay money to look at them in cages,  they were that rare.</p>
<p> More normal content: The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends. Dorothy looked at him curiously.  His head was quite bulged out at the top with brains. "How do you feel?" she asked. "I feel wise indeed," he answered earnestly.  "When I get used to my brains I shall know everything." "Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?" asked the Tin Woodman. "That is proof that he is sharp," remarked the Lion.</p>

<p111 class="p11">The thing was an enormous cave bear, rearing its colossal bulk fully eight feet at the shoulder, while from the tip of its nose to the end of its stubby tail, it was fully 12 feet in length.  As it sighted the Sagoths, it emitted a most frightful roar, and with open mouth charged full upon them.  With a cry of terror, the foremost gorilla-man turned to escape, but behind him he ran full upon his on-rushing companions.</p>

<p111 class="p21">The horror of the following seconds is indescribable.  The Sagoth nearest the cave bear, finding his escape blocked, turned and leaped deliberately to an awful death upon the jagged rocks 300 feet below.  Then those giant jaws reached out and gathered in the next &mdash; there was a sickening sound of crushing bones, and the mangled corpse was dropped over the cliff's edge.  Nor did the mighty beast even pause in his steady advance along the ledge.</p>

<p111 class="p31">Shrieking Sagoths were now leaping madly over the precipice to escape him, and the last I saw he rounded the turn still pursuing the demoralized remnant of the man hunters.  For a long time, I could hear the horrid roaring of the brute intermingled with the screams and shrieks of his victims, until finally the awful sounds dwindled and disappeared in the distance.</p>

<p111 class="p41">Later I learned from Ghak, who had finally come to his tribesmen and returned with a party to rescue me, that the ryth, as it is called, pursued the Sagoths until it had exterminated the entire band.  Ghak was, of course, positive that I had fallen prey to the terrible creature, which within Pellucidar is truly the king of beasts.</p>
